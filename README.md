# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Big Data (postgresql, spark, aws)

## Overview
In this project, we were tasked with assessing and manipulating big data, more particularly reviews related to Amazon products. I chose to conduct my project on pet products. I analyzed the reviews through PySpark, AWS and postgres to determine if there is a presence of bias within reviews due to Amazon vine, Amazon's paid review program. 

## Results
The following table illustrates how many vine and non-vine reviews were collected, and what percentage of each groups' reviews were 5 star reviews.
